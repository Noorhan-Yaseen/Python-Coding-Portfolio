Hostel Booking Predictions 📊🏨
This project leverages machine learning to predict hostel bookings based on historical data. Using various features such as booking date, lead time, and customer behavior, the model forecasts whether a booking will be confirmed or canceled.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and processed real-world data to make it ready for predictive analysis.
Modeling: Applied various machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to predict booking outcomes.
Evaluation: Used key metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall to evaluate and fine-tune the models.
Visualization: Visualized trends and patterns in the data, providing insights into factors affecting bookings.
🔧 Technologies Used:

Python
Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib, Seaborn
This project demonstrates my ability to handle real-world datasets, build predictive models, and visualize results to gain actionable insights. It's a great example of applying data science to a practical problem!
